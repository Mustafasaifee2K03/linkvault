# LinkVault

LinkVault is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload either plain text or files and generate secure, temporary shareable links. The uploaded content is accessible only through a unique link and automatically expires after a specified duration.

This project was developed as a take-home assignment to demonstrate secure link-based access control, backend API design, and full-stack integration.
